# FinalProject_CCAPP

Prehistory. I am working as a volunteer in children education center. Once in a year center get financial support from the city council. All the finances divided into categories by planned activities. 

Problem. Once in a year I need to fill a financial report. In this report I need to mention all the money spent and attach all receipts. Probably, it is not convenient to store data in a Excel table, plus already have been cases when data for the period was lost. It will be easier to store in data in king of database, app.
How to solve? My application will be similar with Hero application. There will be menu, different calculation methods to know how many money is already spent and how many we still have for our project. Also, application will give user opportunity to input/output data (information from the receipt - number, sum, company) for the future report. All the receipt will be divided on groups/categories to simplify sorting.
